# Workshop on Coding Choreographies 

### a [Rehearsal Series](https://jobcb.github.io/rehearsal_series.html) new edition.

"The Body &amp; < >" in collaboration with The WhyNot, LavaLab and Hackers&Designers.

\*17—June—2017 Amsterdam\*

### Short-description

A cross-disciplinary exploration of choreography & (web)code. By ‘rehearsal’ it is meant a sort of temporary stage for experimenting with web design tools which follow choreographic methods and thematic concerns. This format is very similar to a open workshop, open to any participants curious to explore the use of choreographic techniques to generate newness in design, new modes of thinking composition matters, participation, relations and articulations between bodies and technologies. 

Traditionally, a rehearsal is a built in process, a space and time for developing ideas and work acknowledging unexpected and unpredictable results. Another important point about the [Rehearsal Series](https://jobcb.github.io/rehearsal_series.html) is to break the distancing between mind/body, self/other, subject/object, designer/design piece; discovery/invention. Enhancing the idea of process over product: processes of becoming, becoming structures, becoming codes and scripts.

\*Key Concepts\* design, choreography, movement studies, scores and scripts, composition methods, programming languages, and interfaces, design visualizations and interventions, perception, corporeality, hybrid practices.

### Structure:

##### 10h - 11h: introduction; brief warm-up/ exercises in 'physical space'.

> The exercises take as its starting point the condition of our bodies and the movements we carry in our 'muscles' history. As well as our body relationship to cultural codes, engaging in private and collective investigations of what are our 'default' movements.
> Following the media theorist Brian Massumi’s “thinking-feeling of what happens”. An expansion of perception brings us into “affective co-motion”: by opening us to more possibilities for being affected, we increase our own power to affect in return. Integrating movement in the site of a creative practice, “thinking-feeling” in order to “activate the conceptual at work in the pre-articulation of the experiential”.

##### 12h - 13h: analysis of movement scores & programming scripts; and forming work groups.

##### LUNCH

##### 14h - 17h: work sessions; exercises in 'digital space'.

> The point above will offer a blueprint for exploration of the choreographic meaning: How can we become aware of our own bodies/movements? In parallel, to think how can we find alternatives to fixed ways of building space/time and movement qualities on web design environments? Leading to a reflection on ‘Programming and being programmed’; moving away from pre-chroeographed systems, moving towards building our ow choreographies.
> Time dedicated to the experimentation (short critical reflections) using digital interfaces/ web-design tools.

##### 17h - 18h: short presentations of the results; collective discussion/ reflection on the possible relations of choreography to design/technology.


### Choreographic Input:

Focus on [post-modern dance] (pzwart1.wdka.hro.nl/~jo/notebook/series/glossary.html) references, and to include a new research on [Eshkol-Wachman movement notation] (joanachicau.x-temporary.org).

* Viewpoints of time (tempo, duration, rhythmic structures).
* Viewpoints of space (spatial dimensions, relationships, and intensities).
* Kinaesthetic experiments (dynamics / mobility / stability/ simultaneity..).
* Improvisation techniques (repetition / variation / accumulation / substitution / elements of chance).

Introduction to choreographic concepts (theoretical context): references to works by choreographers and/or performers; showing films and scores as examples. 


### Coding Input:

The workshop focus mainly web programming: HTML; CSS and JAVASCRIPT — but is open to other technological approaches, free and open so ware and other computer languages too.

We will explore the use of choreographic techniques as a way to reflect and find alternative paths towards the use of tools, systems of visuality, accessibility, and distribution of information. For more details on the methodology please visit the link: jobcb.github.io/methodology.html

Depending on the level of knowledge of coding, code snippets are available to be downloaded and used as framework to (de/)compose. In the end, the code will be compiled, and made published online on this same link.


### Sources:

Please find all the relevant sources (reading material; tools to work during the worshop;..) in the ['Wiki'] () section.

### Results:

Building process: small groups are created for sharing knowledge, mind mapping and nurturing collective discussion on the topics, references and experiences during the day.

The outcome is a piece of ‘choreographic code' — all participants are invited to contribute to the choreographic code by translating the ideas discussed in the session into html/css/javascript functions or as prototypes developed in other formats.
